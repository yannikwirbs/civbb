# Status

Read at the start of every session; update at the end. Keep it short: the queue lives in GitHub issues.

## Now

- Phase 0 (prove the avatar compiler). Current milestone: **M0.7 Renderer and viewer** (M0.6 closed).
- Next issue: #49 material property curves, the last open issue of M0.7; then M0.8 from #28. #24 to #27 are done.
- `civbb-render` (ADRs 0021 to 0023): `Context` (Vulkan 1.3, validation in debug builds, device selection, one
  queue, gpu-allocator, buffers by device address, bindless and multi-draw-indirect features), `Renderer` (FIFO
  sRGB swapchain with resize, two frames in flight, GPU timestamps `gpu_ms`, `blocked_ms`), `Graph` (colour and
  depth attachments, pooled transient images, buffer resources, sync2 barriers, dynamic rendering), `Scene`
  (shared rest-vertex, attribute, delta, index and skinned buffers, one material buffer, 4096-slot bindless
  textures), `skin` (compute skinning, sparse blendshapes via fixed-point atomics), `Forward` (twelve pipelines:
  PBR, Toon, Unlit x blend x culling; draws batched into runs, one indirect multi-draw per run, vertices pulled by
  address). Shaders are Slang in `crates/render/shaders/` (`skin`, `mesh`), compiled by `cargo xtask shaders`
  (Vulkan SDK 1.4.363.0 at `C:/VulkanSDK/1.4.363.0`) to committed SPIR-V; `ci` fails on a stale one.
- Viewer (ADR 0024): `civbb-client view [<pkg> --key <key> | --avatar lean|bloated] [--copies N] [--frames F]`.
  glTF/VRM go through `civbb build` first (client may not depend on pipeline). Release, reference PC: 100 bloated
  avatars 1.72 ms CPU per frame (systems 0.53 ms), 0.56 ms GPU; 4 Yumeka 1.5 ms CPU, 0.21 ms GPU. AliciaSolid
  renders textured and toon-shaded. Debug builds are ~30x slower on the CPU (validation).
- `civbb-core`: shared math, `jobs::islands` (one rayon job per avatar), per-system `Counters`. `civbb-client`:
  `Model`/`Island` (animator, constraints, IK stub, dynamics, world poses) and `frame::step` with the contact pass
  feeding next frame's parameters (ADR 0020); `civbb-client bench` prints JSON (#23).
- Benchmark on the reference PC (release): 100 bloated avatars 3.23 ms/frame on 1 thread, 0.43 ms on 16 (7.5x);
  1000 avatars 32.6 ms to 3.7 ms (8.9x). Dynamics is ~83 % of island CPU. Corpus avatars have no constraints and
  real converted avatars can't be benchmarked yet (#57, M0.9).
- `civbb-anim`: curve binding, clip sampling, state machines, blend trees, Write Defaults, built-ins, behaviours,
  humanoid muscles and constraints (ADRs 0007 to 0011, 0014, 0018, 0019). `civbb-dynamics`: XPBD PhysBone chains
  with grab/pose, colliders and limits (ADRs 0015, 0016), and contacts with the cross-avatar grid broadphase
  (`contact::step`, ADR 0017). Format v7.
- Unity ground truth: `tools/unity-truth` runs in batch mode and records JSON into crate test dirs (ADR 0013,
  `tools/unity-truth/README.md`). Muscle space and constraints (44 cases, batch play mode) are verified against it;
  animator goldens are still hand-derived (#54).
- Test avatars: `civbb-corpus` (`lean()`, `bloated()`, `generate`, `gltf::to_glb`), and locally `corpus/local/khronos/` (23 Khronos samples) `corpus/local/vrm/` (AliciaSolid 0.x, Seed-san and the twist sample 1.0) and `corpus/local/glb/` (Booth: HAOLAN, Taro, Tessakuchan, Yumeka, converted from FBX; see `corpus/README.md`). `civbb inspect <file>` prints what an avatar contains.
- Progress for the human: https://github.com/yannikwirbs/civbb/milestones

## Blockers and needs-user

- #37, #38 Unity tasks (M0.10, later). Sessions can run Unity themselves now; those two still need the human
  (Creator Companion projects, baselines).

## Decisions in flight

None. ADRs 0017 to 0024 are accepted. Renderer follow-ups: #58 toon outlines (M0.9, parity needs them), #59 GPU
culling, #60 MSAA and multiview, #61 pipeline cache and freeing scene memory, #62 clustered lights and shadows
(Phase 1). Dynamics constants and contact choices marked unverified wait
for parity (M0.9). In M0.10: #52 (body pose), #53 (muscle frames for glTF/VRM), #54 (Unity-recorded animator
goldens), #55 (box contacts, receiver value, body-part senders), #56 (animated constraint properties, VRChat
constraint options). In M0.9: #57 (benchmark packages and constraints).
